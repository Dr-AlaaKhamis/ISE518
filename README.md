# ISE 518: Data Analytics for Reliability and Maintenance 🔧📊

## 📚 Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive overview of data analytics techniques that enhance asset reliability and maintenance performance in an Industry 4.0 environment. Coverage spans the entire analytics pipeline: data ingestion and cleansing, feature engineering, descriptive and diagnostic analysis, predictive modeling, prescriptive optimization, and system observability. Theory is paired with hands-on exercises, and work culminates in a team project applying multiple analytic methods to a real or simulated maintenance problem.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
By the end of the course, participants will be able to  
- 📥 Collect, cleanse, and engineer features from maintenance data sources  
- 📈 Summarize and visualize reliability data, perform clustering, discover association rules, and detect anomalies  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Diagnose failure causes using correlation analysis and structured root‑cause techniques  
- 🔮 Predict failures and remaining useful life to support predictive maintenance strategies  
- 🛠️ Recommend optimal maintenance actions with optimization models and recommender systems  
- 🌐 Implement observability pipelines that use metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards for real‑time monitoring
