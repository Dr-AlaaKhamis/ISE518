# Time-Series Datasets for Reliability Engineering & Industrial Maintenance

A curated collection of **publicly available datasets**—both from open repositories and Kaggle—for:

- **Reliability Engineering** → degradation modeling, survival analysis, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction  
- **Industrial Maintenance** → predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, anomaly detection  

Each dataset link has been verified and is active as of August 2025.

## 📊 Sample Analytics Notebook

👉 To help you get started, we provide a **[sample Jupyter notebook](Sample.ipynb)**:

This notebook demonstrates **EDA** for the AI4I 2020 dataset (or similar CSVs):

- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Summary statistics and missing values  
- Class distribution plots  
- Histograms & boxplots for numeric features  
- Correlation heatmap (matplotlib)  
- Outlier checks  

You can easily adapt it to any dataset from the list above (e.g., MetroPT-3, C-MAPSS, or Kaggle datasets).
