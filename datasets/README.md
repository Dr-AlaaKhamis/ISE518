# Time-Series Datasets for Reliability Engineering & Industrial Maintenance

A curated collection of **publicly available datasets**—both from open repositories and Kaggle—for:

- **Reliability Engineering** → degradation modeling, survival analysis, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction  
- **Industrial Maintenance** → predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, anomaly detection  

Each dataset link has been verified and is active as of August 2025.
